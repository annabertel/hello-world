		<h1>Well, Hello World!</h1>
		<p>My name is Anna and I'm just getting started on my journey into tech. <br>I currently know HTML and CSS, and I'm learning Javascript and responsive web development. </p>

			<p id="about-me">Technology both fascinates and befuddles me... and while I am drawn to it, my true happy place is about as far from my computer screen as it gets: lost-ish on a gorgeous mountain trail with all of my belongings strapped to my back. Having an affinity for both the rugged natural world and the modern technological one makes for a <span class="special-font"> life of lovely juxtaposition</span>. I'm excited by the possibilities offered by the world of tech to address issues with creative solutions and to connect people from the far corners of our planet. </p>
